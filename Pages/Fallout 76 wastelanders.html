    <h1>Breaking news:Fallout 76 wastelanders update delayed</h1>
    <p><strong>Author:</strong>Admin, <strong>Published:</strong>mar 22, 2020</p>
    <p>
      The open beta for Resident Evil Resistance, the new asymmetrical multiplayer spin-off of the Resident Evil series, has been delayed on PlayStation 4 and Windows PC. The Resistance beta was supposed to begin on all platforms starting early in the morning on Friday, March 27. Instead, only the Xbox One version of the beta is currently live. According to an announcement on the game’s website, the delay is due to “technical issues.”

      Capcom hasn’t announced when the other platforms will get the chance to try the game out, but according to its website, the company is “working to resolve the issues as quickly as possible and will keep you updated on its availability.”    </p>
    <p>
      Resistance is a four-on-one multiplayer mode. Four players take on the role of survivors who have to escape. The other player is the Mastermind, and its their job to stop them through whatever devious and torturous means necessary. While the survivors play the game in the style of last year’s Resident Evil 2 remake, the Mastermind plays through a computer terminal where they can use security cameras and a map to lay down traps or spawn enemies for the survivors to fight. The Mastermind can even take direct control of certain enemies.

      The Xbox One version of the Resident Evil Resistance beta is scheduled to last until 3 a.m. EDT on Friday, April 3. As for the other betas, whenever they go live, they’re likely to last about a week as well.

      Last week, Fallout 76 players began stockpiling toilet paper, an amusing mimicry of the baffling real-world response to the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Today, however, the impact of the outbreak was felt in a less humorous fashion,
      as Bethesda announced that the launch of the Fallout 76 Wastelanders update will be delayed by a week.
      Bethesda said on Twitter that its employees, like those of many other studios, are now working from home to help prevent the spread of the virus. Its live games continue to operate as normal, but the change has curtailed its ability to do
      proper final testing, and as result it's been pushed from April 7 to April 14.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wastelanders update is a big one. It will add human NPCs and quests to the game, revamp the original main quest, bring in new factions and locations, add unique companions with romance options, incorporate a Fallout 3-style dialog system,
      and more. Overall, the update will make the multiplayer-focused Fallout 76 much more like a conventional, singleplayer Fallout game, something a lot of fans have been clamoring for. It was originally slated to be out in late 2019, but was
      pushed into 2020 in October of that year.
      "We've done everything we can do minimize the delay and can't wait for everyone to play. A special thanks to all our Private Test Server players for all your help," Bethesda said. "We know this is a stressful time, and we can't thank you enough
      for all the support you've given each other and us."
